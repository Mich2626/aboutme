<h2><b><i><u><p style="text-align: center">Introducing My Self</p></u></i></b></h2>
	<u><span style="font-size: 25px"><span style="color: Red">About Me!</span></span></u> My name is "Michael" I am a sixteen years old boy currently studying in secondary School. I live in Obowo, Imo state. I'm the seventh born of my parents and we are eight in number, Whoever I am today is because of my parents/family and God.</p>
 <u>  <span style="font-size: 25px"><span style="color: Red">My Story!!</span></span> </u>  I am a person who is positive in life" and a person who experience how any step of this world goes! I don't like to read books, but sometimes I do. There are many things I like to do, to see and to experience, I like to listen, I like to see the moonlight 🌒 at night, I like to feel the music flowing on my face, and also like to  do experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night 🌃.</p>
I use to learn a lot about how life goes and about people, so in this way, I study how the movement of this world and also the characters of people.</section>
<p>In my life I know that I'm not perfect and I never try to be, but one thing is true! that I am who I am ❤️!.</p>
